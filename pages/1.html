		<h3>Fine I will do it myself</h3>

		<p> I'm actually really annoyed that I need to use the expressjs framework to get any basic functionality in node.js. I really wish there was a simple tutorial out there that explained how powerful nodejs was all on its own. I looked around briefly and found <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Node_server_without_framework">this</a> article, but that was it. Nothing regarding that builds in analytics, functionality that parses the body of post requests, or allows you to build your own templating engine. I find this to be horrific, so I am starting this series to be able to just that. I want to build a simple NodeJS webserver that allows you to build on top of it without having to download any packages.</p>
